Brackets-MaterialAngularJS-CodeHints
====================================

Extend Brackets HTML code hints and [collif](https://github.com/coliff)'s [Brackets-HTML5CodeHints](https://github.com/coliff/Brackets-HTML5CodeHints) with AngularJS elements like ng-include, ng-view and attributes such as ng-class, ng-controller, ng-app.

Once more: extended [sirajc](https://github.com/sirajc)'s [Brackets-AngularJS-CodeHints](https://github.com/sirajc/Brackets-AngularJS-CodeHints) with MaterialDesign elements and attributes (md-*) - see: https://material.angularjs.org
